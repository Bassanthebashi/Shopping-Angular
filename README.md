# Shopping
Simple shopping app. User can register, login, choose multiple products with specific quantity, put them in the cart, then submit an order.
Admin can display all orders and approve or reject the order depending on the stock of products.

# ShoppingApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
